This repository contains the model code, plotting, and final results files used to make the figures in the "Opportunities for flexible electricity loads such as hydrogen production from curtailed generation" paper.

## Published figures

To recreate the published figures run:

`source make_publication_figures.sh`

The exact values of any figure can be extracted with print statements in the python files run by `make_publication_figures.sh`

## Results files

All results file used to make the published figures are in `results_files`. `results_files/notes.md` describes which files are for which scenarios.
