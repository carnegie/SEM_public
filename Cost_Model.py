#  a time series of generation, and returns the hourly cost under the assumption
#  that the fixed costs are distributed across the generation that needed that
#  amount of capacity or less.
#
#  For example, let's say you had 5 hours of operation, with dispatch of
#     dispatch = [ 0, 1, 1, 1, 2 ]
#  And a fixed_cost and var_cost of 1 $/kWh
#  The dispatch related costs would be [0, 1, 1, 1, 2]

#  But with 2 kW of capacity for 5 hours, you needed 1 kW of capacity for 4 hours, adding
#  5/4 = 1.25 $/hr to the cost of those hours. You needed an additional 1 kW
#  of capacity, adding 5/1 = 5 $/hr for that time so the capacity related costs
#  would be [0, 1.25, 1.25, 1.25, 6.25] for a grand total of
